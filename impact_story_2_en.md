<h1>Helping people find the right immigration program</h1>

*2023-2024*

I led the team that created a tool called  “Explore immigration program”, a new tool that simplified access to immigration programs by aligning user needs, research insights, and digital service best practices.


---


## **Context**
* IRCC offers dozens of immigration programs, but information was scattered across multiple pages.
* Many users had no clear starting point, leading to confusion, errors, and high support demand.
* A previous tool (Come to Canada) existed, but user feedback showed it wasn’t meeting expectations.
* There was an opportunity to design something more user-centred and accessible, using evidence and testing.


---


## **My role**
* Managed a cross-functional project team of researchers, designers, developers, and content specialists.
* Oversaw a review of existing tools (like Come to Canada) and analysis of user feedback to identify pain points.
* Guided the design of a prototype addressing findings, with a focus on clarity and inclusiveness.
* Directed two rounds of formative usability testing, iterating based on user insights.
* Orchestrated a progressive launch with robust monitoring and analytics to track performance.
* Led post-launch improvements, including reducing long lists of results to better match user expectations.

## **Impact**
* Since launch, the tool has been used over 1 million times to help people navigate immigration programs.
* Provided a clear, accessible entry point for users navigating complex immigration options.
* Reduced confusion and improved task success, as evidenced by analytics and user feedback.
* Became a flagship example of evidence-based, iterative design in IRCC’s digital presence.
* Continues to support thousands of users daily, reducing support demand and improving trust.

## **What I learned**
* Leading means orchestrating diverse expertise — success came from trusting the team while holding the overall vision.
* Iteration and monitoring are as critical as launch — ongoing improvements made the tool more effective.
* User needs should anchor government digital services, even when policies are complex.
