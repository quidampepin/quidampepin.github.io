  <span class="title">Building a web improvement team at IRCC</span>
</h1>


*2023-2026*

I created and led a pilot team dedicated to **evidence-based continuous improvement**, shaping not only IRCC’s digital content but also how the organization approaches web design and service delivery.


---


## **Context**
* IRCC’s web presence was large, fragmented, and often inconsistent. 
* No dedicated team existed to systematically improve content quality, user experience, and usability. 
* Leadership wanted to experiment with a new approach, and asked me to manage a pilot team with significant autonomy. 
* The mandate: improve IRCC’s web presence in ways that were measurable, sustainable, and user-centred.

## **My role**

* Created the vision and mandate for the team, grounded on evidence-based continuous improvement. 
* Defined processes for identifying issues, testing solutions, and measuring impact.
* Recruited a multi-disciplinary team (content designers, UX specialists, researchers, developers). 
* Built a team culture around collaboration, openness, and a strong service mindset. 
* Championed the use of research, design, and testing as core practices for government web work. 
* Oversaw projects ranging from quick content fixes to the design of major new tools.

## **Impact**
* Delivered dozens of improvements across IRCC’s web presence, from small content changes to complex flagship tools. 
* Improved task success rates and reduced user confusion across high-traffic pages. 
* Established new ways of working that proved so effective they are now being integrated into regular web teams. 
* Positioned the team as a trusted partner for policy, communications, and IT stakeholders. 
* Demonstrated that continuous improvement can scale in a complex, policy-heavy environment.

## **What I learned**
* Hiring the right people to do the job is crucial. 
* Setting up a vision, culture, and credibility is just as important. 
* A pilot can drive change at scale if it delivers tangible results and models new ways of working. 
* Evidence-based practices resonate widely when they lead to clear improvements for users and for the organization.
