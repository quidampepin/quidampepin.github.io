I helped Canadians access complex public health information more easily by redesigning the **Health Infobase landing page** and creating a **design manual** that improved clarity and consistency.

---

## **Context**
* The Health Infobase is a key Government of Canada platform for public health data (for example, chronic diseases, mental health, COVID-19).
* Over time, the landing page became cluttered and dated, with dozens of competing links and no clear information hierarchy.
* Users, including researchers, policymakers, and the publicl, struggled to find the data they needed.
* Updates were being made without a consistent design approach, creating risks for accessibility and usability.

## **My role**
* Conducted a rapid assessment of the landing page using analytics, content review, and  heuristics.
* Redesigned the landing page to reduce clutter, highlight priority topics, and improve readability.
* Conducted unmoderated usability testing to improve the redesign before launch
* Created a lightweight design manual (principles, ideas and patterns) for health data products.
* Collaborated with subject matter experts and web publishing staff to align on priorities and content placement.


---


## **Impact**
* The redesign improved alignment with Canada.ca standards and user expectations.
* The design manual was adopted as a reference tool, improving consistency across future updates.
* Set a precedent for pairing tactical design fixes with sustainable, system-level improvements.


---


## **What I learned**
* Even small, tactical interventions can deliver lasting systemic impact if paired with guidance.
* Creating a clear framework (manual) helps prevent regression when multiple teams touch the same content.
* Success comes from balancing quick wins with long-term stewardship.
