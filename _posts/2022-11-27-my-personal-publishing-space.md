After several unsuccessful attempts in the past, I decided to create a personal publishing space. Why not just talk about a blog? Because it won't just be a space for posting blog posts. There will also be short fiction texts, as well as notes, to quickly share a link or an idea.

## My favorite subjects

Much of what I plan to write is related to my work: content design , UX, Government of Canada web presence and service delivery, and evidence-based continuous improvement). 

I intend to do it while respecting my code of ethics, of course (I want to write a post on this question, but in the meantime this post written by Sean Boots reflects my position quite well: [Principles for blogging as a public servant](https://sboots.ca/2020/01/21/principles-for-blogging-as-a-public-servant/). 

But I will not limit myself to my work, particularly in the Fiction section. I'll talk about whatever I want to, in my own way.

In short, this should be a rather eclectic publishing space.


## In Fernch... and in English

After much thought, I decided to publish in both languages. At first, I had thought of writing in English, so that I would be understood by the majority. Then I thought about publishing only in French, my mother tongue. Then I finally decided to publish in both languages. 

Why? 

First, several federal public servants publish this type of text. I am thinking among others of [Sean Boots](https://sboots.ca/), [Honey Dacanay](https://honeygolightly.medium.com/), [Paul Craig.](https://federal-field-notes.ca/) et [Andrea Hill](https://afhill.medium.com/). To my knowledge, the vast majority of these texts are published in English only. I have long said that I would like to see these texts published in both languages. I decided to show that it was possible.

Publishing in both languages is my way of injecting a bit of the second official language into the public space.

Also, I spend my days working in English. Writing in my mother tongue is a pleasure that I rarely allow myself.

So, I will write in French, and do my best to translate and publish in both languages. 

## A Jekyll site, published on GitHub

A few technical notes in closing.

I decided to build this space using Jekyll, publishing directly to GitHub. It's simple to use, free and open. Also, I wanted a very minimalistic design, to put the emphasis the text.

I started from [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), and created my own [GitHub repository](https://github.com/quidampepin/quidampepin.github.io).
