Thomas awoke to the soft light of a progressive dawn. Pleasant music, carefully selected by Amber for a voluptuous awakening, enveloped the room. Amber's voice, so natural, so clear and comforting, so “perfect”, seemed to come from every corner of the apartment:

<!--more-->

“Good morning Thomas. I hope you slept well“

“Very well, very well, I think.“ 

“That's not what the telemetry in your bed suggests, Thomas...“

“It’s not?“

“Your perspiration was more abundant than usual. You changed position far too often. 45 times, to be exact. And the dream analyzer indicates that you've been having very restless dreams, Thomas.“

“Hum... it's possible, I'm actually feeling a bit tired this morning...“

“I warned you last night that chocolate interferes with sleep.“

“I know, Amber, but even so, once in a while, it can’t be that bad...“

“We'll make everything right very soon, Thomas, trust me.“

“Thank you, Amber.“

“Would you like to know what’s the plan for today?“

“Yes, of course...“

As Thomas got up and headed for the bathroom, Amber detailed the day's plan:

“Today, June 4, is going to be sunny, with a high of 20 degrees Celsius. It's rather cool this morning, so I've chosen clothes for you that will be warm enough for the cool morning air, but light enough for this afternoon. You have an important meeting with Mr Davis at 9 o'clock. Traffic today is expected to be quite heavy, so I've asked the car service to be here at 8.”

“What, I have to go in person?!“

“Of course, Thomas.“

“Can't we do this by videoconference?“

“Mr. Davis was very clear: he wants to see you in person.“

“Man, he's so old-fashioned sometimes...“

Thomas slipped nonchalantly under the shower spray. According to the judiciously positioned sensors, Thomas' skin was precisely 36.7 degrees Celsius. 

To ensure optimal comfort without risking skin damage, Amber had set the water temperature to exactly 39.2 degrees Celsius. Lively, stimulating music played throughout the house. It was a playlist designed to increase self-confidence, energy, clarity of mind, everything Thomas would need for this meeting with his boss. 

Stepping out of the shower, Thomas positioned himself in front of the sink. He placed both feet on the two sensor tiles. 

As he admired himself in the mirror, Amber continued: 

“Your sugar levels are a little high, but your iron levels are good. You've gained 0.1 kilos since yesterday, and 1.2 kilos since last week. Your vitamin B12 and magnesium levels are too low. Please take these tablets.”

A small door opened in the vanity counter. A receptacle held three small tablets. Thomas swallowed them in one gulp. 

“Given your condition, I recommend a 75% protein and 25% synthetic fat substitute. Is that okay, Thomas?”

Thomas pouted.

“Amber, I think I would like eggs and bacon this morning...“

“It's up to you. But I must warn you: you ate bacon just 5 days ago, and you've gained weight this week. Eating bacon today would cost you 5 meal credits, and increase your health insurance by 2 credits per week. And that's not the kind of meal that will help you in your meeting with Mr. Davis.“

“Okay, let's go with the substitute... Amber?“

“ Yes?“

“Couldn't I just have a little syntephamine tablet?“

“I could give you one, but your ration for the month is almost up. And it would probably make you too confident for your meeting. I wouldn't recommend it.“

“Is coffee okay, then?“

“It's waiting for you in the dining room.“

Thomas got dressed without questioning Amber's choices. He headed for the dining room and engulfed his meal replacement, making sure to chew well ("Congratulations Thomas, your meal time was excellent: neither too fast nor too slow. You've just earned a health insurance credit!"). It was almost 8 o'clock. 

He headed for the lobby, looked at himself in the mirror, and slipped on his shoes.

“Your transport has arrived,” said Amber. 

Thomas looked at his watch: 8 o'clock sharp. On time, as usual. 

Entering the driverless vehicle, Thomas was greeted by the diaphanous screens. He had lots of choice. To his right, the route map, with real-time information on traffic, accidents and possible changes to the planned route. To his left, his schedule for the day and the music list, both prepared by Amber. And in front of him, a summary of what he needed to know for his important meeting. He decided to use all the screens in the car to work. He couldn't let himself get distracted.  He could no longer see the outside world, the weather or the journey, and he had turned off the music. 

Thomas was completely absorbed in the meeting that was coming up. His future was at stake. He had gambled a lot. He would be proposing major changes to the credit distribution algorithm. With these changes, he thought he had hit the bull's-eye: better reward the most deserving and manage available resources more efficiently, all without penalizing the most disadvantaged. Mr. Davis would be impressed, he was sure. Provided he hadn't missed anything...

He had a good 45-minute drive to fine tune everything. 

“Amber, can we go over the simulations of the new algorithm together?“

“Of course, Thomas. They haven't changed since the last three times you asked me, but we can go over the details.“

“ Yes, I don’t want to miss anything, and know the numbers by heart...“

Thomas suddenly heard a shrill, whistling sound that grew louder and louder.

Then the explosion. First the flash of light, then the noise, then the shock, then the darkness.

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

Thomas awoke painfully, with an unbearable headache. His whole body was in pain. He couldn't wait for Amber to give him his pills, or even an injection, why not?  

As his eyes adjusted to the intense daylight - why didn't progressive dawn work? - and began to extricate himself from Morpheus' arms, Thomas anticipated Amber's reassuring voice, her particular inflection. His anxiety increased by the second. Amber's voice didn't come. 

The pain suddenly focused on the inside of his left forearm. 

He watched in horror as someone - a real, flesh-and-blood person! - was sewing his skin together, like a piece of fabric! 

“What the... “

“Relax, sir, relax... I'm almost finished.“

Confusion gripped Thomas's mind. 

“But why, sir? What have you done? What am I doing here?“

“Oh, I don't know how or why you got here, sir... For that you'll have to talk to Corinne.“

“Corinne?“

“Yes... Corinne, she's the one who brought you here. All I did was sew up the hole. They had to remove the chip that serves as your assistant.“

“My chip? Amber? Why did you do that?“

Thomas jumped to his feet, indignant, appalled, distraught. He continued: 

“But I need Amber! She has to call a car to take me home! What about my meeting? Shit, my meeting? I can't miss it! Amb... “

Thomas was about to ask Amber what time it was, and how late he'd be for his meeting, but he held his tongue. 

The nurse resumed: 

“Around here, my dear, no chip. No assistants. No technology. It would be far too easy to spot us...“

“Spot you?“

“Remember the accident?“

“The accident?“

“You don’t remember anything? Good...“

“Huh? I just don't understand...“

“Corinne will explain...“

Before Thomas could reply, the door swung open. 

Corinne entered the room unceremoniously. She quickly approached Thomas, seemingly oblivious to his dismay. 

She introduced herself by looking him straight in the eye: 

“Hello, I'm Corinne. What's your name?“

“Huh, Thomas.“

“Last name?“

“Lebel. What right have you to...“

Corinne cut him off:

“You're here by a stroke of luck. Or bad luck, depending on how you see it. “

“I don't quite understand...“

“Of course you don't...“

Thomas was taken aback by Corinne's unwavering assurance. He wanted to protest, to demand that Amber be handed over to him immediately, to shout at the top of his voice. He felt incapable of doing so, as if paralyzed. Corinne continued: 

“It's quite the shock, I know... Do you remember anything?“

“Not really... I was on my way to a very, very important meeting, then a loud noise, then nothing...“

“The vehicle you were in found itself in the middle of a large convoy of goods. Our organization had been planning this raid for weeks... You were just in the wrong place at the wrong time, that's all.“

“Your organization? A raid? What on earth are you talking about?“

Thomas then noticed Corinne's red-and-black patch. Four letters: FRUS.

Corinne raised her shoulders and chin, and looked defiantly at her interlocutor: 

“Our organization, Mr. Lebel, is like a beacon in the dark night of tyranny. We are the Front for Resistance, Unity, and Solidarity!“

“The what?“

“We're rebels. Outlaws. In the noblest sense of the word. Those whom the government has not yet subdued. We're still standing. We're everywhere, and nowhere at the same time. “

Thomas's headache was getting worse. What was this despicable circus all about? What was the meaning of all this grandiloquent gibberish?

“Rebels? Resistance fighters? But the government ended the civil war years ago! The anti-social elements have been reduced to nothing! The final defeat of cultural Marxism is celebrated every year! What on earth are you talking about?“

“Oh, we're still here, Mr. Lebel. And more alive than ever. We're multiplying attacks like today's. It's payback time. The government doesn't want you to know it, of course, but we're still here. And we will fight, all of us, to the bitter end, to restore justice.“

Corinne had finished her flamboyant plea with a vengeance, as if driven by something greater than herself. 

Thomas, stunned, didn't know what to think. Was it a bad joke, an elaborate hoax to test his level of commitment to this perfect society? Was it real? Could there really be organized resistance? 

But who would want to abandon all that the 4th Empire had brought us? Who would want to return to this world of uncertainty and turbulence? Corinne snapped him out of his reverie: 

“Rest up, Mr. Lebel. Michel will give you a sedative”, she said, turning to the man in the white coat who had sewn up his arm. “Get a good night's sleep. Tomorrow, you'll have a decision to make. Perhaps the most important decision of your life. We'll give you a choice. Either stay with us, and join the resistance. Or return to your perfect, smooth, false comfort. It's up to you.“

Thomas awoke from a long sleep. He raised himself on his elbows, and found that he was still in the same room. He hadn't noticed it during Corinne's visit, but for what must have been a hospital, the room was very basic. No monitors, no wiring, no sophisticated appliances. Nothing but a bed and four walls. 

He was about to instinctively call for his faithful Amber when the door opened. 

Corinne entered, as haughty as ever. 

“Did you sleep well, Thomas?“

“Yes, I think so... But how long have I been here?“

“That's not important. Get up, put on those clothes, and meet me outside.“

Corinne threw a pile of old clothes on the chair beside the bed, then left. 

Thomas struggled to get dressed. The pants didn't fit him at all, and neither did the sweater. What a filthy comedy. God, he missed his made-to-measure wardrobe... He went out and found himself outside. 

“Come on, follow me. I'll show you our camp.“

What he saw puzzled him. If this was a ruse, it was an elaborate one. Dozens of people were coming and going in this sort of makeshift camp. Some were carrying supplies, others were armed. One group was hotly debating a resolution to be passed at the next session. 

A cacophony. An indescribable chaotic affair. 

Thomas showed his astonishment. He pointed his finger at one of the rebels carrying a bag:

“What is this woman doing?“

“They're getting organized, Thomas, they're getting organized!“

“They?“

Thomas recalled with horror the injunctions of the radical feminists, before they were put down for good. With their ridiculous “neutral” pronouns... Fortunately, the 4th Empire had put an end to such madness! 

Corinne's wry smile revealed the amusement she felt at seeing him unravel his shaken certainties. 

“They’re preparing for the next battle. Here, everyone knows what needs to be done. For things to change.“

Thomas was skeptical: 

“But things are just fine under the 4th Empire! Why would you want them to change? The algorithms take care of optimizing everything, no one starves anymore...“

Corinne cut him off:

“Wrong! Everything is put in place to make you believe that no one is starving! The cities are full of people barely surviving on the inadequate leftovers of your perfect society... The police hunt them down everywhere! And they shoot on sight!“

“But that's impossible, we'd never let that happen!“

“The images you see are all controlled, Mr. Lebel! Your beloved chips are all interconnected! Your movements are always in areas where you see only perfect buildings, perfect people, order and beauty... But the world is dying! To create your perfect world, the vast majority of humanity is starving, in a devastated planet.“

Thomas protested loudly: 

“I don't believe you! It can't be true!“

“The camp is full of witnesses to the horror... All you have to do is ask...“

Thomas felt his legs give way under him... 

“Do you have a syntephamine tablet?“

Corinne burst out laughing:

“That's a good one! There's no syntephamine here, and no synthalcohol either. None of that. But we do have marijuana, which we grow ourselves, and beer, made right here. Excellent products, by the way!“

“What?! All these natural things are extremely dangerous! The 4th Empire banned them long ago! I'm not touching that stuff... Well... can you at least show me the way to the synthe-sex machine? It might help me relax...“

This time, Corinne couldn’t hold back:

“The synthe-sex machine! Bwahahaha! Really, that’s too much...“ 

Then she suddenly became serious again: 

“No, Thomas... Here, if you want sex, you'll have to do it the old-fashioned way. With a real person. And I warn you: no tolerance for sex without consent... You'll be executed on the spot.“

“What? I'm going to have to find someone who wants to... how do you say... have sex with me?“

Corinne's laughter grew louder: 

“And from the look on your face right now, it's a long shot, Mr. Lebel! Come on, I want to show you something.“ 

Reaching the edge of the camp, Thomas noticed the sentries, armed to the teeth. 

“See those guards over there?“

“They're hard to miss!“

“This is the boundary. Inviolable. Anyone crossing this line is shot without questions.“

“Drastic much?“

“We've got no choice! We've developed a system to jam government surveillance systems. In our invisible bubble, the drones can't see us.“

“Really?“

“Of course they can’t. We also have a portable version, with a much shorter range - we use them for raids, among other things.“

Corinne took a long pause, then looked Thomas straight in the eye.

“Mr. Lebel, what we're doing is very dangerous. One wrong move and it's all over. You have to make up your mind tonight. If you decide to stay, there'll be no turning back. But if you want to leave, we can still erase every trace of this day from your memory, and we’ll move you to a place where the authorities can find you.“ 

“But they'll know I wasn't where I was supposed to be! They'll see my scar!“

“Of course they will! But believe me, they have no interest in your misadventure becoming public... They don't want our existence to be known. They'll fix you right up. With your lovely chip in your arm and all. And everything will be done so that you won't even know you were gone. You'll go back to your life as before. Your dull, regimented, polished life. Dazzled by the illusion of freedom. The choice is yours.“

“How long do I have?“

“Two hours.“

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

Thomas awoke to the soft light of a progressive dawn. Pleasant music, carefully selected by Amber for a voluptuous awakening, enveloped the room. Amber's voice, so natural, so clear and comforting, so “perfect”, seemed to come from every corner of the apartment…

Thomas scratched his forearm. He didn't notice the fine scar just above his chip. 

Another wonderful day ahead, in a brave new world...
