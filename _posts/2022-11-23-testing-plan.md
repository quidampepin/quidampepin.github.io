## Summary-Test

We are running usability testing on the Infobase landing page prototype to make sure it works as intended. The landing page should make it easy to find different types of data products. 


## Methodology


* Formative testing - the goal is to uncover usability issues to fix, not establish a success rate baseline
* Unmoderated testing through UserZoom
* English only
* All tasks will start from the prototype landing page
* 30-minute sessions
* 5 tasks + 2 additional questions
* 6 participants (4 desktop, 2 mobile)
* Start with a pilot (desktop) to make sure the test works well


## Participants



* 6 participants
* From anywhere in Canada
* Over 18
* No specific demographics
* Screen out: federal gov employees
* Consent to record: I’m assuming UserZoom panel participants already gave their consent through UserZoom.


## Introduction and background questions


### Introduction

(Depending on how UserZoom works, you may not need this intro text - putting it here just it in case) \


Thank you for agreeing to participate in this study.  The whole session should take roughly 30 minutes.

The session will be recorded. Please turn off your camera and close anything personal, private or sensitive.

Today we’re asking you to use a test environment on the Government of Canada’s website. We will ask you to complete a number of tasks, one at a time. Always start from the prototype link provided with each task. Don’t spend more than 5 minutes on each task.

As you complete each task, we want you to think aloud as much as possible.  You can say what you are looking at, what you are trying to do, and what you’re thinking.  This may feel a bit unnatural at first, but it will help us uncover issues with the website.  (removed the sentence about other people observing)

Please remember: you are not being tested; in fact, you are doing the testing!  So, if you can’t figure out how to complete a task, it’s ok as there are no wrong answers. It just means that we may need to present the information differently. Please do not provide any personal information that can identify you.

Also, your participation and answers will not affect your access to Government of Canada services and benefits


### Screening questions



* Do you work for the Government of Canada? _(If yes: screen out; If no: continue)_
* We sometimes use recordings in public blog posts, with any personally identifying information hidden and voices altered. Do you consent to us using your recording in this way?  _(continue with the testing whether they answer yes or no)_

### Additional questions (after the tasks)



* What are your overall impressions of the Health Infobase page where you started your tasks?
* What did you think of how the filters and categories worked?
* Do you have anything else to add?


## Metrics

We will look for:



* Task success (whether or not people found the answer) - most tasks involve finding a product or a set of products)
* Time on task
* Usability issues to fix

Because of the low number of participants, we will not provide success rates in percentages (would not be statistically significant).
